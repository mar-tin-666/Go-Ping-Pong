# Go Ping Pong

Simple Ping Pong game for two players written in Go. Just for fun :)

## How to play
- Player 1 - left (blue) paddle control: W and S keys
- Player 2 - right (red) paddle control: UP and DOWN arrows keys
- Press SPACE to serve
- Press R to reset

## Known issues
- The collision model needs some refinement
- The ball acceleration model needs some refinement
- The ball's bounce directions are random - it could depend on the bounce location on the paddle
